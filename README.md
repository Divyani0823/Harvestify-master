# **GreenTech Hub üå±**  
### A cutting-edge ML & DL powered platform for precision farming: Crop recommendations, Fertilizer suggestions, and Disease identification.
---

## **üí° MOTIVATION**  
Agriculture is a critical pillar of economic growth, especially in countries like India, where a significant portion of the population relies on farming for their livelihood. With the rise of technology, AI, and ML are becoming indispensable tools for enhancing farming practices. Through **AgriTech Insights**, we aim to:

- Simplify farming processes for farmers by providing actionable insights through technology.
- Integrate Machine Learning and Deep Learning into agriculture to help farmers make informed decisions and optimize their resources.
- Offer a comprehensive platform with three key applications:
  1. **Crop Recommendation**: Helping farmers choose the right crop based on soil data.
  2. **Fertilizer Recommendation**: Guiding farmers on which fertilizers to use based on soil and crop needs.
  3. **Plant Disease Detection**: Identifying plant diseases and suggesting remedies via image analysis.

## **üìä DATA SOURCES**  
The data used in this project comes from reliable, open-source platforms:
- **[Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset)** - A custom-built dataset that helps predict the best crops for different soil types.
- **[Fertilizer Suggestion Dataset](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Harvestify/blob/master/Data-processed/fertilizer.csv)** - A handpicked dataset for recommending fertilizers based on soil composition.
- **[Disease Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)** - A comprehensive dataset to train models for plant disease classification.

## **üî® TECHNOLOGIES USED**  
This project is powered by the following technologies:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Flask, Bootstrap, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Deployment**: Heroku for live hosting, Git for version control

---

## **üöÄ DEPLOYMENT**  
The platform is live and deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), where users can access the website and experience the functionalities in real-time.  

**Live Website**: [AgriTech Insights](https://harvestify.herokuapp.com/)  
Note: The website may load slowly if the server is inactive. Please be patient.

## **üñ•Ô∏è HOW IT WORKS**

### **Crop Recommendation System**  
- **Inputs**: Soil nutrient values (N, P, K), city, and state.
- **Functionality**: Based on the given data, this model predicts the most suitable crops to grow in the user's area.
  
### **Fertilizer Suggestion System**  
- **Inputs**: Soil composition and crop type.
- **Functionality**: Based on the input data, this tool identifies which nutrients are deficient or in excess, recommending specific fertilizers to balance soil quality.

### **Disease Detection System**  
- **Inputs**: A clear image of the plant's diseased leaf.
- **Functionality**: This system identifies the plant type, diagnoses the disease, and offers suggestions for curing it.
- **Supported Crops**:
  - Apple
  - Blueberry
  - Cherry
  - Corn
  - Grape
  - Pepper
  - Orange
  - Peach
  - Potato
  - Soybean
  - Strawberry
  - Tomato
  - Squash
  - Raspberry
